This project was a quick add to my portfolio. The idea of this
project came from my confusion of the Monty Hall problem, I never
understood how it worked. I was certain for a long time that it
was indeed 50/50 and not 33/66. If you've never heard of this
problem I explain it at the top of the .py file. I was so certain
that even when the host took away a door it was still a 50/50
chance you would win, even after watching a few video about it.

I decided to code my own program that simulates the problem.
Setting up the doors, the correct door, the random contestant
pick, and whether the contestant switches their choice or not.
I was surprised that when I finished and had it run hundreds/thousands
of times to get close to its win percentage that it is indeed
33/66%. I then changed the code to have whatever amount of doors
in the game show as you want, to see differences in win percentage
when choosing to switch. 

This project took me around 3 hours. I was just impressed with myself
that I did not end up favoring my conclusion (50/50), I was also
somewhat angry that I proved myself wrong. I still didn't completely
understand until a friend asked me to guess a number between 1-100.
I said 77, he replied with "Ok, I'm gonna remove all other guesses except
97, do you want to switch?". I then understood the concept that
all the other guesses are compressed into the remaining answer, whilst
your original guess it still a 1/100 chance.
